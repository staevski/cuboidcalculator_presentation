This application allows the user to enter the length, width, and height and calculate the Volume and the Surface Area of a Cuboid.

It uses Scatterplot3d to plot a point with the Length, Width and the Height as coordinates.

Three text boxes are created to enter length, width, height and calculations for Volume and Surface Area are done in the server.R
